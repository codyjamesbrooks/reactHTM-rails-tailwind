# Rails Project Starter repo

Tailwind CSS enabled using tailwindcss-rails
React(ish) Components enabled by using [importmap](https://github.com/rails/importmap-rails) to pin 
- React
- React-dom
- [HTM](https://github.com/developit/htm)
to the page. 

I based some of this starter from the following DHH [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k73LKxim6tw) where he demonstarted a technique that allows you to write JSX smillar code, but doesn't require a transpiller, meaing it could be import mapped directly to the page.

Provides a React like development experience, while not requiring a transpiller.
